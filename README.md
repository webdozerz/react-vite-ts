# Vite + React + Typescript + Eslint + Prettier

A starter for React with Typescript with the fast Vite and all static code testing with Eslint and formatting with Prettier.
I found out about Vite and I wanted to have a boilerplate for the technologies that I use. You can find more about these in the following links: [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Eslint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

## Installation

Clone the repo and run `npm install`

or Run command

```
npx degit TheSwordBreaker/vite-reactts-eslint-prettier project-name
```

## Start

After the successfull installation of the packages: `npm run dev`

## Steps in Vscode

#### (works with better with this template)

1. Install Eslint and prettier extension for vs code.
2. Make Sure Both are enabled
3. Make sure all packages are Installed. (Mostly Eslint and prettier in node_modules)
4. Enable formatOnSave of vs code
5. Open a .tsx file and check if the bottom right corners of vs code have Eslint and Prettier with a double tick


If Everything is Good Then It Should Work, but let me new if something else happens
